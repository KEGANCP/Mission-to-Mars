### Project Overview
Robin has aspirations to one day work for NASA, and has a significant interest in Mars exploration. Her immediate goal is to create a source to get all the latest news and updates with a single click of a button. I was able to achieve this by utilizing the below tools, to scrape data from webpages, and present in an easy to digest format via a web app.
#### Tools
- Python
- Beautiful Soup
- Splinter
- Flask
- Mongo DB
- HTML
- Bootstrap

### Analysis
With the use of Splinter, I was able to automate our web browser to begin scraping with the help of Web-driver Manager. 
Here is an example of my starting code to being scraping & creating dictionaries for the desired data:

Utilizing the below code I was able to extract full resolution images of Mars hemispheres as requested by Robin:

Below is an example of code we used able to extract images to our web app:

With some retructure within our HTML we were able to fulfill Robins vision as shown below, as well as provide a clean view from a mobile source:

### Summary
I was able to attain Robins final vision with the help of the above tools mentioned. These functions help automate and simplify creating this web app immensely. Now, with just the push of a button, any recent news & updates will appear on your screen, whilst these tools do all the leg work in the blink of an eye. This is a great starting point for Robin, if there is more data she wanted to add to the page we could easily modify and add code to the existing code to include.
