### Project Overview
Robin has aspirations to one day work for NASA, and has a significant interest in Mars exploration. Her immediate goal is to create a source to get all the latest news and updates with a single click of a button. I was able to achieve this by utilizing the below tools, to scrape data from webpages, and present in an easy to digest format via a web app.
#### Tools
- Python
- Beautiful Soup
- Splinter
- Flask
- Mongo DB
- HTML
- Bootstrap

### Analysis
With the use of Splinter, I was able to automate our web browser to begin scraping with the help of Web-driver Manager. 
Here is an example of my starting code to being scraping & creating dictionaries for the desired data:

With this code we were able to extract images to our web app as shown below:

With some retructure within our HTM we were able to fulfill Robins vision as shown below, as well as provide a clean view from a mobile source:
